**Project Proposal** <br>
1. Team: Vasco Madrid, Sarah Sunderman
2. Data Set: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/bad-drivers
3. Objective: We plan to create a pie chart that compares the number of fatal collisions in South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Georgia. The pie chart will be divided into these 4 parts by percentage of fatal accidents in each state out of the total number of fatal accidents in all states. Each part will be divided by the percentage of accidents depending on the condition of the collision: drivers who were speeding, alcohol-impaired, not distracted, had not been involved in any previous accident. The user will be able to change the condition of collision that is being shown on the pie chart.
